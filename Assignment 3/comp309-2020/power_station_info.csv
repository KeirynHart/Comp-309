Aniwhenua is named after the falls which are adjacent to the power house. The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse.

Due to its close proximity to Hamilton's urban centre, Arapuni provides a voltage support role for power transmissions to the area. Recent upgrades to the station have enhanced its capability in this area. This station is occasionally used for frequency keeping. The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added. In 2001, work was completed on four of Arapuni's turbines to increase capacity from 24.7MW to 26.7MW each and to improve their peak efficiency to 94 percent.",,"EL Database,Electricity Commission,EMS (Reconciliation Manager List), www.mightyriverpower.co.nz",7,GEN.Hydro.Waikato.Arapuni

In 1914 the power station was commissioned with three turbines and was then progressively expanded over the next decade. Much of the station still dates from this period. In 1930 the Acheron River was diverted into Lake Coleridge, increasing the catchment area to more than 800 square kilometres and in 1977 a diversion of the Wilberforce River further increased the amount of water, boosting average annual output to 205 GWh. The Coleridge power station is fed from Lake Coleridge via 2 kilometres of tunnels and pipes, and after passing through the powerhouse the water empties into the Rakaia River approximately 140 meters below the level of the Lake. Lake Coleridge can store 2 to 3 months inflows.

The station was recommissioned in 1983. The reservoir for this station is Lake McLaren and the canal links the reservoir to the station. Lake McLaren was formed in 1925 by the construction of a 26m high concrete arch dam across the lower Mangapapa River to operate the now decommissioned McLarens Falls Power Station. Water from the lake passes through a gated inlet structure into a 2.5 kilometre long canal. The construction of the canal involved moving 2, 400, 000 cubic metres of soil at depths up to 46 m below original ground level, making it one of the larger canals in New Zealand. The depth of the water in this canal is 6m and the width at normal operating level is 30m. Flow velocities are up to 0.9m per second depending on machine settings and water levels.

This cooling system uses water pumped from the adjacent Waikato River. After use, the cooling water and steam condensate is discharged back into the river. Gases found in the steam supply are pumped from the condenser and released to the air via gas stacks situated on the power station roof. The hot geothermal water is discharged into a system of drains (that lead to the Waikato River), or it is injected back into the ground.
